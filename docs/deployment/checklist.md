## Troubleshooting Reference

### If Backend Won't Start
1. Check logs: `docker-compose logs backend`
2. Check environment file: `cat .env.production`
3. Verify database is running: `docker-compose ps`
4. Check ports: `netstat -tulpn | grep 10000`

### If Frontend Can't Connect
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API URL in Vercel environment variables
3. Test backend directly: `curl http://your-ip/api/v1/health`
4. Check CORS settings in backend `.env.production`
5. Check nginx configuration if using reverse proxy

### If Database Connection Fails
1. Check PostgreSQL container: `docker-compose logs postgres`
2. Verify credentials in `.env.production`
3. Test connection: `docker exec -it cdtms-postgres psql -U cdtms_user -d track_management`
4. Check database host (should be `postgres` in Docker network)

### If Socket.IO Not Working
1. Check browser console for WebSocket errors
2. Verify `REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL` matches backend
3. Check `SOCKET_CORS_ORIGIN` in backend
4. Verify nginx WebSocket proxy configuration

## Emergency Rollback

If something goes wrong:

```bash
# Stop current deployment
cd /opt/cdtms/backend
./deploy.sh stop

# Restore database from backup
gunzip -c backups/db_backup_LATEST.sql.gz | docker exec -i cdtms-postgres psql -U cdtms_user -d track_management

# Restart services
./deploy.sh start

# Or redeploy from scratch
./deploy.sh deploy
```

For frontend:
```bash
# Rollback to previous deployment
vercel rollback
```

## Final Notes

üìù Save this checklist and mark items as you complete them during deployment.
üìù Keep environment files and passwords in a secure password manager.
üìù Schedule regular maintenance windows for updates.
üìù Monitor logs regularly for the first week after deployment.
üìù Test backup restoration process at least once to ensure it works.

**Good luck with your deployment! üöÄ**
