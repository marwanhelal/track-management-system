# Manual Progress Tracking Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the manual progress override feature, allowing supervisors to adjust engineer progress percentages based on work quality, separate from automatic hours-based calculations.

---

## ✅ COMPLETED COMPONENTS

### 1. Database Layer ✅
**File:** `database/migrations/003_add_manual_progress_tracking.sql`

**Created Tables:**
- `progress_adjustments` - Full audit trail of all manual progress adjustments
  - Tracks per-work-log and per-phase adjustments
  - Stores both calculated and manual progress percentages
  - Requires supervisor reasoning for all adjustments

**Modified Tables:**
- `work_logs` - Added columns:
  - `manual_progress_percentage`
  - `progress_notes`
  - `progress_adjusted_by`
  - `progress_adjusted_at`

- `project_phases` - Added columns:
  - `calculated_progress` (hours-based)
  - `actual_progress` (supervisor-adjusted)
  - `progress_variance` (difference)

**Database Functions:**
- `calculate_hours_based_progress(phase_id, engineer_id)` - Calculates progress from hours
- `get_actual_progress(phase_id, engineer_id)` - Gets supervisor-adjusted or calculated progress
- `sync_phase_progress(phase_id)` - Aggregates progress from all engineers

**Automatic Triggers:**
- Auto-sync phase progress when work logs change
- Auto-sync when progress adjustments are made
- Backfilled all existing phases with calculated progress

## 🔧 INTEGRATION STEPS

### Step 1: Run Database Migration ✅
```bash
cd "D:\cdtms new"
PGPASSWORD=25180047m5 psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d track_management -f database/migrations/003_add_manual_progress_tracking.sql
```

### Step 2: Restart Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Create Frontend Components
Create the 3 dialog components and enhance the 2 existing components as described above.

### Step 4: Test Flow
1. **As Engineer:** Log some hours on a phase
2. **As Supervisor:**
   - View ProjectPhases component
   - Click "Manage Progress" button
   - See PhaseProgressSummary
   - Click "Adjust" for an engineer
   - Set manual progress (e.g., 2% instead of 10%)
   - Add reason: "Work quality issues, rework required"
   - Submit
3. **Verify:**
   - Phase shows updated actual_progress
   - Variance is displayed
   - Engineer can see their adjusted progress
   - History dialog shows the adjustment

## 📊 DATA FLOW

### Automatic Calculation Flow:
```
Engineer logs 10 hours
  ↓
Database trigger calculates: (10 / 100) * 100 = 10%
  ↓
Sets phase.calculated_progress = 10%
Sets phase.actual_progress = 10% (no adjustments yet)
```

### Manual Adjustment Flow:
```
Supervisor reviews work
  ↓
Determines work is poor quality
  ↓
Sets manual_progress_percentage = 2%
Provides reason: "Rework required due to errors"
  ↓
Creates progress_adjustments record
  ↓
Database trigger updates:
  - phase.actual_progress = 2%
  - phase.progress_variance = -8%
  ↓
Engineer sees adjusted progress with supervisor note
```

## 📝 API USAGE EXAMPLES

### Adjust Work Log Progress
```typescript
await apiService.setWorkLogProgress(workLogId, {
  manual_progress_percentage: 2,
  adjustment_reason: "Work quality issues, requires rework"
});
```

### Adjust Phase Engineer Progress
```typescript
await apiService.setPhaseEngineerProgress(phaseId, engineerId, {
  manual_progress_percentage: 30,
  adjustment_reason: "Quality assessment: 30% complete"
});
```

### Get Progress History
```typescript
const { data } = await apiService.getProgressHistory(phaseId, engineerId);
// Returns array of all adjustments with supervisor names and timestamps
```

### Get Phase Progress Summary
```typescript
const { data } = await apiService.getPhaseProgressSummary(phaseId);
// Returns array of all engineers with calculated vs actual progress
```

## 💡 DESIGN DECISIONS

1. **Database-Level Calculations:** Progress calculations are done in PostgreSQL functions for consistency and performance
2. **Automatic Triggers:** Progress syncs automatically when work logs or adjustments change
3. **Dual Display:** Always show both calculated and actual progress for transparency
4. **Required Reasoning:** Every adjustment must have a reason for audit trail
5. **Non-Destructive:** Original hours-based calculations are preserved alongside manual adjustments
6. **Variance Tracking:** System tracks and displays the difference between calculated and actual
7. **Historical Audit:** Complete history of all adjustments with timestamps and supervisor info

---

## 🔒 SECURITY & PERMISSIONS

- ✅ Only supervisors can adjust progress
- ✅ Engineers can view their own progress and adjustments
- ✅ All adjustments are logged with supervisor ID and timestamp
- ✅ Database constraints prevent invalid progress percentages (0-100)
- ✅ Required reasoning field prevents arbitrary adjustments
- ✅ API endpoints validate user roles before allowing modifications

---

## 🎨 UI/UX GUIDELINES

**Color Coding for Variance:**
- 🟢 Green: -5% to +5% (minor variance)
- 🟡 Yellow: ±5% to ±10% (moderate variance)
- 🔴 Red: >±10% (significant variance)

**Progress Display Format:**
- Show as: "Actual: 30% (Calc: 40%)" when different
- Tooltip: "Variance: -10% | Last adjusted by John Doe on Jan 15, 2025"

**Action Buttons:**
- "Adjust Progress" - Primary action for supervisors
- "View History" - Secondary action for all users
- "Manage Progress" - Opens comprehensive summary dialog
