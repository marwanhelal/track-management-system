# üöÄ FINAL DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST - CDTMS

**Created:** October 2, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Production with Fixes Required
**Estimated Time to Complete:** 30-45 minutes

---

## üìã OVERVIEW

You have **3 documents** to guide your deployment:

1. **THIS FILE** - Quick checklist (start here!)
2. **PRE_DEPLOYMENT_FIXES.md** - Critical security fixes (read next)
3. **SYSTEM_REVIEW_AND_DEPLOYMENT.md** - Full deployment guide (reference during deployment)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: DO THIS FIRST!

### STEP 1: Run Cleanup Script (2 minutes)

```cmd
cd "D:\cdtms new"
cleanup_before_deployment.bat
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Delete 6 duplicate migration files
- ‚úÖ Delete unused SQL files
- ‚úÖ Verify environment files exist

---

### STEP 2: Generate Secure Secrets (3 minutes)

Open **Node.js command prompt** and run:

```bash
# Generate JWT Secret (copy the output)
node -e "console.log('JWT_SECRET=' + require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"

# Generate Refresh Token Secret (copy the output)
node -e "console.log('JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=' + require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
```

**Save these outputs!** You'll need them in the next step.

---

### STEP 3: Configure Backend Environment (5 minutes)

Edit: `backend\.env.production`

**Replace these placeholders:**

```env
# Line 13: Set strong database password (16+ characters)
DB_PASSWORD=CHANGE_THIS_TO_STRONG_PASSWORD
# Example: DB_PASSWORD=MyCompany2025!SecureDB@Pass

# Line 18: Paste JWT_SECRET from Step 2
JWT_SECRET=GENERATE_A_NEW_64_CHARACTER_SECRET_HERE
# Example: JWT_SECRET=a1b2c3d4e5f6...  (128 characters)

# Line 20: Paste JWT_REFRESH_SECRET from Step 2
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=GENERATE_A_DIFFERENT_64_CHARACTER_SECRET_HERE
# Example: JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=z9y8x7w6v5u4...  (128 characters)

# Line 28: Replace with your server IP
CORS_ORIGIN=http://YOUR_SERVER_IP
# Example: CORS_ORIGIN=http://192.168.1.100

# Line 35: Replace with your server IP
SOCKET_CORS_ORIGIN=http://YOUR_SERVER_IP
# Example: SOCKET_CORS_ORIGIN=http://192.168.1.100
```

**Save the file.**

---

### STEP 4: Configure Frontend Environment (2 minutes)

Edit: `frontend\.env.production`

**Replace these placeholders:**

```env
# Line 4: Replace with your server IP
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:5005/api/v1
# Example: REACT_APP_API_URL=http://192.168.1.100:5005/api/v1

# Line 5: Replace with your server IP
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:5005
# Example: REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://192.168.1.100:5005
```

**Save the file.**

---

### STEP 5: Verify Configuration (2 minutes)

**Checklist:**

- [ ] `backend\.env.production` has strong DB password (16+ chars)
- [ ] `backend\.env.production` has 128-char JWT_SECRET
- [ ] `backend\.env.production` has 128-char JWT_REFRESH_SECRET
- [ ] `backend\.env.production` CORS_ORIGIN has your server IP
- [ ] `frontend\.env.production` has your server IP in both URLs
- [ ] All duplicate migration files deleted (only 3 files remain)
- [ ] `backend\drop_preferences_tables.sql` deleted

---

## üîê SECURITY VERIFICATION

**IMPORTANT:** Before proceeding to deployment:

- [ ] **NEVER** commit `.env` files to Git
- [ ] `.gitignore` file exists and includes `.env`
- [ ] Database password is different from development
- [ ] JWT secrets are random 128-character strings
- [ ] Server IP addresses are correct for your company network
- [ ] You have saved your passwords and secrets in a secure location (password manager)

---

## üì¶ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT?

If all checkboxes above are ‚úÖ, you're ready to deploy!

**Next Steps:**

1. Copy entire `D:\cdtms new` folder to USB drive or network share
2. Go to your Windows Server 2012
3. Open **SYSTEM_REVIEW_AND_DEPLOYMENT.md**
4. Start with **Section 9: Windows Server 2012 Deployment Guide**
5. Follow steps 1-10 carefully

---

## üéØ DEPLOYMENT TIMELINE

| Phase | Duration | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Pre-Deployment** | 15 min | Run cleanup, generate secrets, configure .env files ‚úÖ YOU ARE HERE |
| **Server Preparation** | 30 min | Install Node.js, PostgreSQL, NSSM on Windows Server |
| **File Transfer** | 10 min | Copy project files to server |
| **Database Setup** | 15 min | Create database, run schema, run migrations |
| **Backend Setup** | 20 min | Install dependencies, build, configure |
| **Frontend Setup** | 20 min | Install dependencies, build production |
| **Service Installation** | 15 min | Install as Windows services using NSSM |
| **Testing** | 20 min | Verify all components working |
| **User Setup** | 10 min | Create first admin user, configure phases |
| **Training** | 30 min | Show users how to use the system |
| **TOTAL** | **3 hours** | Complete deployment and initial setup |

---

## ‚ùå COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **‚ùå Forgetting to generate new JWT secrets**
   - Don't use development secrets in production!

2. **‚ùå Using same database password as development**
   - Change it to a strong production password

3. **‚ùå Wrong server IP in environment files**
   - Test `ping YOUR_SERVER_IP` before deployment

4. **‚ùå Not running database migrations**
   - Must run 001, then 002 in order

5. **‚ùå Skipping Windows Firewall configuration**
   - Ports 80 and 5005 must be open

6. **‚ùå Not testing before going live**
   - Test from another computer on the network

---

## üÜò IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

**During Deployment:**
- Refer to **Section 12: Troubleshooting** in SYSTEM_REVIEW_AND_DEPLOYMENT.md
- Check log files: `C:\inetpub\cdtms\logs\`
- Verify services are running: `sc query CDTMSBackend`

**After Deployment:**
- Test health endpoint: `http://SERVER_IP:5005/health`
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Review backend logs for error messages

---

## ‚úÖ POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION

Once deployed, test these:

- [ ] Can access frontend: `http://SERVER_IP/`
- [ ] Backend health check works: `http://SERVER_IP:5005/health`
- [ ] Can register first user
- [ ] Can login with created user
- [ ] Can create a project
- [ ] Can add phases to project
- [ ] Can log work hours
- [ ] Real-time updates work (open same project in 2 browsers)
- [ ] Theme switching works
- [ ] All navigation links work
- [ ] Logout works

## üìû FINAL PRE-DEPLOYMENT MEETING AGENDA

Before deploying to production server, have a 15-minute meeting to verify:

1. **Server Access**
   - Who has administrator access to Windows Server 2012?
   - Do we have the login credentials?

2. **Network Configuration**
   - What is the server's IP address on company network?
   - Are other computers on the network able to reach it?
   - Is the server always on (not a laptop that gets closed)?

3. **Database Backup Plan**
   - Who will be responsible for weekly backups?
   - Where will backups be stored?

4. **User Training**
   - When will users be trained on the system?
   - Who will be the first Supervisor (admin)?

5. **Go-Live Date**
   - When is the planned deployment date?
   - What time of day (recommend after hours or weekend)?

6. **Support Plan**
   - Who can users contact if they have issues?
   - What's the escalation process?
